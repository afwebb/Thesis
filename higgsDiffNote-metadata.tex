\AtlasAbstract{%
        Several theories Beyond the Standard Model modify the momentum spectrum of the Higgs Boson, without significantly altering the overall rate of Higgs produced from top quark pairs. A differential measurement of the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum is performed for events where the Higgs Boson is produced from top quark pairs and decays to final states that include multiple leptons. The channels considered include two same-sign lepton and three lepton final states. The momentum of the Higgs is predicted using a neural network, based on the kinematics of its decay products. An effective field theory approach is used to parameterize and place limits on the strength of potential six-dimensional operators.
