\AtlasAbstract{%
        Several theories Beyond the Standard Model modify the momentum spectrum of the Higgs Boson, without significantly altering the overall rate of Higgs produced from top quark pairs. A differential measurement of the Higgs transverse momentum provides a way to search for these effects at the LHC. Because of the challenges inherent to reconstructing the Higgs in multilepton final states, a deep learning approach is used to predict the momentum spectrum of the Higgs for events where the Higgs Boson is produced from top quark pairs and decays to final states that include multiple leptons. The regressed Higgs $p_T$ is fit to data for events with two or three leptons in the final state, and estimates of the sensitivy to variations in the Higgs $p_T$ spectrum are given.
