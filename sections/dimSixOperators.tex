While the SM has been tested to great precision, particularly at the LHC, it is generally accepted that it is only valid up to a certain energy scale. It is assumed that above a certain energy, at the scale where something like a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) or quantum gravity become relevant, the SM will not be applicable.
