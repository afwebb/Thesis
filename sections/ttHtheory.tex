While the Higgs Boson has been discovered, its interactions with other particles have not yet been measured. Of particular interest are the interactions of the Higgs with the top quark. As the heaviest SM particle, the top quark has the strongest Yukawa coupling to the Higgs. 

By measuring the production of the Higgs boson in association with top quark pairs ($t\bar{t}H$), the higgs-top Yukawa coupling can be measured directly.
