This study used data collected by the ATLAS detector over the period from 2015-2018, representing 138.9 $fb^{-1}$ of data at an energy of 13 TeV. 

Several Monte Carlo generators were used to simulate both signal and background processes. For all of these, the effects of the ATLAS detector are simulated in Geant4.
