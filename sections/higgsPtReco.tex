Reconstructing the momentum of the Higgs boson is a particular challenge for channels with leptons in the final state: Because all channels include at least two neutrinos in the final state, the Higgs can never be fully reconstructed. However, the momentum spectrum can be well predicted by a neural network when provided with the four-vectors of the Higgs Boson decay products, as shown in section \ref{sec:truthLevelReco}. With this in mind, a sophisticated approach involving several layers of MVAs is used to reconstruction the Higgs momentum. 

The first layer is a Neural Network designed to select which jets are most likely to be the b-jets that came from the top decay. The kinematics of these jets are fed into the second layer, also a BDT, which is designed to identify the decay products of the Higgs Boson itself. The kinematics of these particles are then fed into a deep neural-network, which predicts the momentum of the Higgs.

\subsection{Truth Level Reconstruction}
\label{sec:truthLevelReco}

Machine Learning algorithms are trained to identify the decay products of the Higgs Boson using MC simulations of $t\bar{t}H$ events. Reconstructed physics objects are matched to truth level particles, in order to identify the parents of these reconstructed objects. 

\subsection{b-jet Identification}
\label{sec:bjetID}

In both the 3l and 2lSS channels, one or b-tagged jet is required. Therefore, for events which have exactly one, or more than two, b-tagged jets, deciding which combination of jets correspond to the top decay

\subsection{Higgs Reconstruction}
\label{sec:higgsID}

Techniques similar to the b-jet identification algorithms are employed to select the decay products of the Higgs. 

\subsection{$p_T$ Prediction}
\label{sec:ptReco}

Once the most probable decay products have been identified, their kinematics are used to reconstruct the momentum spectrum of the Higgs Boson. 

\subsection{3l Decay Mode}
\label{sec:decay3l}

In the 3l channel, there are two possible ways for the Higgs to decay, both involving intermediate W boson pairs: Either both W bosons decay leptonically, in which case the reconstructed decay consists of two leptons (referred as the fully-leptonic 3l channel), or one W decays leptonically and the other hadronically, giving two jets and one lepton in the final state (referred to as the semi-leptonic 3l channel). In order to accurately reconstruct the Higgs, it is necessary to identify which of these decays took place for each 3l event.
