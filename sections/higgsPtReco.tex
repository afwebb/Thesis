Reconstructing the momentum of the Higgs boson is a particular challenge for channels with leptons in the final state: Because all channels include at least two neutrinos in the final state, the Higgs can never be fully reconstructed. However, the momentum spectrum can be well predicted by a neural network when provided with the four-vectors of the Higgs Boson decay products, as shown in section \ref{sec:truthLevelReco}. With this in mind, a sophisticated approach involving several layers of MVAs is used to reconstruction the Higgs momentum. 

The first layer is a boosted decision-tree (BDT) algorithm designed to select which jets are most likely to be the b-jets that came from the top decay. The kinematics of these jets are fed into the second layer, also a BDT, which is designed to identify the decay products of the Higgs Boson itself. The kinematics of these particles are then fed into a deep neural-network, which predicts the momentum of the Higgs.
