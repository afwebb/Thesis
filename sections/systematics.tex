The systematic uncertainties that are considered are summarized in table \ref{tab:systematics}. These are implemented in the fit either as a normalization factors or as a shape variation or both in the signal and background estimations. The numerical impact of each of these uncertainties is outlined in section \ref{sec:results}.

The uncertainty in the combined 2015+2016 integrated luminosity is derived from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016 \cite{lumi}.

The experimental uncertainties are related to the reconstruction and identification of light leptons and and b-tagging of jets, and to the reconstruction of $E^{miss}_T$. The sources which contribute to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale \cite{jes} are decomposed into uncorrelated components and treated as independent sources in the analysis. 

The uncertainties in the b-tagging efficiencies measured in dedicated calibration analyses \cite{btag_cal} are also decomposed into uncorrelated components. The large number of components for b-tagging is due to the calibration of the distribution of the BDT discriminant.

The systematic uncertainties associated with the signal and background processes are accounted for by varying the cross-section of each process within its uncertainty.
