\par Several theories Beyond the Standard Model predict a modification of the momentum spectrum of the Higgs Boson, without a significantly altered rate of Higgs produced in association with top quark pairs ($t\bar{t}H$). This provides a physical observable that can be used to search for new physics based on data collected by the LHC. This thesis presents techniques and preliminary results for a differential measurement of the Higgs transverse momentum in $t\bar{t}H$ events with multiple leptons in the final state, using data collected at an energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC.

\par Because of the challenges inherent in reconstructing the Higgs in multilepton final states, a deep learning approach is used to predict of the Higgs. The regressed Higgs $p_T$ spectrum is fit to data for events with two same-sign leptons and three leptons in the final state, in order to extract normalization factors for high ($p_{T}(H) > 150$ GeV) and low ($p_{T}(H) < 150$ GeV) momentum $t\bar{t}H$ events. Preliminary results are presented for 80 $fb^{-1}$ of data, with projected results shown for 140 $fb^{-1}$.

\par This thesis also details a measurement of WZ + heavy flavor production, a significant background to $t\bar{t}H$ that is poorly understood. This study targets events with three leptons and one or two jets in the final state, using 140 $fb^{-1}$ of  $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV data. A measured cross-section of $X\pm X$ fb ($X\pm X$ fb) is observed for WZ + $b$ (WZ + $c$) with 1 associated jet and $X\pm X$ fb ($X\pm X$ fb) for WZ + $b$ (WZ + $c$) with 2 assoicated jets.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A measurement of $WZ$ + heavy flavor is performed using 140 $fb^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The expected cross-section of WZ + $b$ with 1-jet is $1.74^{+0.82}_{-0.75}(stat)^{+0.53}_{-0.48}(sys)$ fb, and $14.6 \pm 2.5 (stat) \pm 2.3 (sys)$ fb for WZ + $c$, with a correlation of -0.22 between them. An expected significance of 2.0 is observed for WZ + $b$ in this region.

For the 2-jet regions, an expected significance of 1.7 is observed for WZ + $b$, with an expected cross-section of $2.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}(stat)^{+0.95}_{-0.83}(sys)$ fb. For WZ + $c$, a cross-section of $12.7 \pm 3.2 (stat) \pm 2.7 (sys)$ fb is expected for 2-jet events. A correlation of -0.26 is observed for WZ + $b$ and WZ + $c$.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{part:conclusion}

A method of employing machine learning techniques in order to reconstruct the momentum sprectum of the Higgs boson produced in association with top quark pairs has been presented for events with multiple leptons in the final state. Preliminary results for using these techniques to perform differential measurements in this channel have been presented: Using 80 $fb^{-1}$ of data, normalization factors of $\mu_{t\bar{t}H\ high\ p_T} = 2.1^{+0.62}_{-0.59}(stat)^{+0.40}_{-0.43}(sys)$ and $\mu_{t\bar{t}H\ low\ p_T} = 0.83^{+0.39}_{-0.40}(stat)^{+0.51}_{-0.53}(sys)$ are measured for events with Higgs $p_T$ $>$150 GeV and $<$150 GeV, respectively. Projected results for 139 $fb^{-1}$ of data give sentivity of $\mu_{t\bar{t}H\ high\ p_T} = 1.00^{+0.45}_{-0.43}(stat)^{+0.30}_{-0.31}(sys)$ and $\mu_{t\bar{t}H\ low\ p_T} = 1.00^{+0.29}_{-0.30}(stat)^{+0.48}_{-0.50}(sys)$.
